## Functionalities

This application offers the following functionalities:

- Item Display: The app showcases items in a layout as depicted.
- Read More: When users click "Read Full," it opens a modal/pop-up displaying item details. Buttons within the modal/pop-up don't need to function.
- Deletion: Clicking the "Delete" button on the landing page removes selected item(s) from the list.
- Select All: The "Select all" checkbox conveniently selects all items in the list.

Note: Certain features, such as the "Publish" button, hashtag buttons, and the search bar on the landing page, do not require functional implementation.
